Death notes for broken links in your documentation files

## Why this tool

**lawliet** is a tool for searching broken links in your documentation files.

When working in large projects where your only option for organizing your own SDK documentation is to keep a bunch of .md files inside a Git repo, mantaining all the links inside every document becomes a real nightmare.
