Death notes for broken links in your documentation files

![lawliet](https://github.com/mguellsegarra/lawliet/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Why this tool

**lawliet** is a tool for searching broken links in your documentation files.

When working in large projects where your only option for organizing your own SDK documentation is to keep a bunch of .md files inside a Git repo, mantaining all the links inside every document becomes a real nightmare.

## What does

This tool will:

* Search recursively for plain text files with the extenion you choose (.md, .html, .txt, etc.)
* On those files it will look up for URL's
* For every file that has URL's inside, it will check every entry making a GET request
* Will save the results that ended with an error response code different than 200, or when the URL have preconfigured text inside its content
* It will export the results in a CSV file

## Installation

_You'll need Node v6.9.4 installed on your OS of choice_

* Just clone this repo:

```
#Â git clone https://github.com/mguellsegarra/lawliet.git
#Â cd lawliet
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```
# npm install
```

## Configuration

You can customize **lawliet** in order to fit your needs. For that, there's a *config.json* file, like this one:

```json
{
  "not_found_text": "The page you're looking for could not be found (404)",
  "not_authenticated_text": "Login Mordorbank",
  "outputFilename": "death_notes.csv"
  "extensionFiles": ".md",
  "hosts": [
    {
      "host": "mordorbank.org",
      "proxy": "http://10.0.0.1:8080",
      "cookies": [
        "some_auth_session_token"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "strictSSL": false,
  "cookiePrefix": "cookie-",
}
```

* **not_found_text** (required) â†’ 
* **not_authenticated_text** (required) â†’ 
* **outputFilename** (required) â†’  
* **extensionFiles** (required) â†’ 
* **hosts** _(optional)_ â†’ 
* **strictSSL** _(optional)_ â†’ 
* **cookiePrefix** _(optional)_ â†’  

## Usage

And a CLI interface will ask you for the path, and more parameters.
